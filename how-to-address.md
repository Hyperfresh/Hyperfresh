# A brief explanation of my identity
Hi! As you've probably gathered from my email signature [or however you got here], I openly identify as non-binary [put simply, I don't identify as either male or female.] I use `they/them` pronouns, and my *legal* title is `Mx.` [pronounced "mix"]. Yes, sometimes I identify as a humanoid octopus [known as [Octolings](https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Octoling_(playable)) from Splatoon!] online, but that's more of an online persona I like to imagine myself as than anything!

When you're talking to me or about me, I'd gladly appreciate if you could address me with the right pronouns and title, as well as addressing me using gender-neutral conventions. Here's how you can help!

# Using the right pronouns and title
Once again, I use `they/them` pronouns [where others may use the more common `he/him` or `she/her`]. When people converse, I like it when people also address me with gender-neutral conventions. Here's a few examples of both correct pronouns and addressing in action.

## EXAMPLE: Pronouns and addressing
- "Hey, that guy over there? I've heard that *they've* done a lot of things for *their* high school."
- "Hm? What things have *they* done?"
- "Well for a start, I think that *their* school's catered to ensure that *they* refer to *them* with the right pronouns!"
- "Wow! I'm really glad that the school's making a big effort to make things right for *them*! They seem to be a young, bright *person* of potential."
- "I'm very impressed by the effort that *they're* putting into *their* school subjects as well!"
- "I know, right? *They* never cease to amaze people by *their* hard work."
- "I think a lot of teachers like how open *they* are as a non-binary *person*, and I think it's awesome that people resepct *them* and *their* wishes."

*You may have noticed that people said "guy" above - other enby people may have a problem with this, but personally I think "guy(s)" are starting to become a gender-neutral term, so I'm fine with it. However, make sure you still check with others!*

## EXAMPLE: Titles and introduction
"Hi! I'm *Mx.* Paul Asencion, I use *they/them* pronouns. Pleased to meet you! What is your name and pronouns?"

*Sometimes, I may also ask for the other person's name or pronouns to further spread awareness on addressing people correctly.*

# Don't be afraid!
It's hard for people to get around a concept they may have just heard of. Act humbly, be patient and let time take its course until people eventually get it right!
## Don't be afraid if you make a mistake!
We're all human, and sometimes we make mistakes! It's the process of learning, and people will take time to get used to referring me and others the way they wish to be addressed [when they've been addressed differently in the past].

## Don't be afraid to correct others as well!
If someone's not getting it right, kindly help them out! A simple "excuse me, sorry to interrupt - Hy uses they/them pronouns." Remember though, people are human so don't snap at them for constantly getting it wrong!

## Don't be afraid to ask!
I don't bite! If you want to make sure that you're not offending me [thank you so much for checking!], you can shoot an email or DM on a social pipe, and I'll respond to your questions when and where I can!
