# Personal projects
Here are some of the things I've done on GitHub so far:
## OzAlert
|Lang                     |Engine / Framework|License   |
|-------------------------|------------------|----------|
|![JavaScript](src/js.png)|Node.js / Electron|Apache 2.0|

Inspired by [JQuake](https://jquake.net) - a Japanese earthquake monitor application - OzAlert aims to alert you of any incident at any Australian location at any given time. It has the ability to read out alerts and show these on a map as well!

OzAlert is currently in a private work-in-progress, and I hope to reveal more soon! The application's first public release will only cover South Australia's bushfires [info provided by the [Country Fire Service](https://cfs.sa.gov.au)], but more alerting protocols and services are to be added in the future.

And of course, the application on its own is open source, which means you an take it and run wild with any additions you'd like to add. Like VS Code and Chrome, I intend to build on OzAlert and provide a free (but proprietary) OzAlert application, but the library it's based on will remain open source.

## CAutomator

Custom-built for a server of friends I'm in, [**CAutomator**](https://github.com/Hyperfresh/CAutomator) manages user profiles, birthdays and custom roles, as well as send out bushfire alerts. You can read more on [the bot's dedicated website](https://hyperfresh.github.io/CAutomator). 
### Previous versions of CAutomator

## Casio Collection
[![Casio Collection Card](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=Hyperfresh&repo=Casio-Collection)](https://github.com/Hyperfresh/Casio-Collection)

|Lang                 |Engine           |License  |
|---------------------|-----------------|---------|
|![Python](src/py.png)|Casio MicroPython|Unlicense|

If you have a Casio fx-CG50 AU and has MicroPython, [**Casio Collection**](https://github.com/Hyperfresh/Casio-Collection) has a few scripts to make your mathematics life a little less harder. And best of all, the code is public domain - which means you can take the code and run, and I won't even judge you.

# School assignments
And here are things I had to do for school.

## CrashApp
[![CrashApp Card](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=Hyperfresh&repo=CrashApp)](https://github.com/Hyperfresh/CrashApp)
|Lang               |Stack|License   |
|-------------------|-----|----------|
|![PHP](src/php.png)|XAMPP|Apache 2.0|

For a Digital Technologies project at school, I built a theoretical application that could store crashes that occur in South Australia, and display them in an easy manner such as a bar chart or an intelligently formatted sentence result.

## Car Dodger Concept
[![Car Dodger Card](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=Hyperfresh&repo=Car-Dodger-Concept)](https://github.com/Hyperfresh/Car-Dodger-Concept)

|-------------------------|-----------------------------|----------|
|![JavaScript](src/js.png)|JavaScript on the web / p5.js|Apache 2.0|

It was a [simple car dodger that I made for a school assignment](https://github.com/Hyperfresh/Car-Dodger-Concept), what else were you expecting?

## Visitor Register
[![Visitor Register Card](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=Hyperfresh&repo=VisitorCode)](https://github.com/Hyperfresh/VisitorCode)

Why are you even looking at my old school assignments anyway?
