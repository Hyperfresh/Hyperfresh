# Projects
Here are some of the things I've done on GitHub so far:
## CAutomator

Custom-built for a server of friends I'm in, [**CAutomator**](https://github.com/Hyperfresh/CAutomator) manages user profiles, birthdays and custom roles, as well as send out bushfire alerts. You can read more on [the bot's dedicated website](https://hyperfresh.github.io/CAutomator). Previous versions of CAutomator were built on JavaScript and Python 3.8.

## Casio Collection
[![Casio Collection Card](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=Hyperfresh&repo=Casio-Collection)](https://github.com/Hyperfresh/Casio-Collection)

|![Python](src/py.png)|Casio MicroPython|Unlicense|

If you have a Casio fx-CG50 AU and has MicroPython, [**Casio Collection**](https://github.com/Hyperfresh/Casio-Collection) has a few scripts to make your mathematics life a little less harder. And best of all, the code is public domain - which means you can take the code and run, and I won't even judge you.

## CrashApp

|![PHP](src/php.png)|XAMPP|Apache 2.0|

For a Digital Technologies project at school, I built a theoretical application that could store crashes that occur in South Australia, and display them in an easy manner such as a bar chart or an intelligently formatted sentence result.
